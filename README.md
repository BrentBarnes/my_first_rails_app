# My First Rails App

All of the code in this project was precreated by The Odin Project.

The point of this was to explore and walk through the life cycle of a rails app from creation to deployment.

### Introduced To

* Generating a scaffold
* Creating and migrating the database
* Starting the rails server
* Creating a heroku remote
* Configuring Gemfile in preparation for deployment (changing sqlite3 to postgresql for production)
* Configuring the root route
* Deploying to heroku
